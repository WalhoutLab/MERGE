This guidance shows how to reproduce the flux potential analysis (FPA) results in Figures 5B, 6, and S7 by FPA. Additionally, we provided a walkthrough guidance for running FPA on the generic model of [iCEL1314](http://wormflux.umassmed.edu/index.html) as well as any other metabolic network model, with any given expression dataset.

### Reproducing the FPA results for the <i>C. elegans</i> dual tissue model

This script helps run iMAT++ for the seven <i>C. elegans</i> tissues for which aggregated gene expression data is available from [Cao <i>et al</i>., 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28818938/). Input files used are indicated in the walkthrough script [here](writeFluxPotential_dual.m). In short, three main input files are used: [the dual version of iCEL1314](./../input/Tissue.mat), [the distance matrix](input/distance_raw.mat) and [expression table](input/expressionTable.tsv). The distance matrix is generated by the [distance generator](./../MetabolicDistance). Due to the file size limits of GitHub, we provide the compressed distance matrix in ".mat" format for data reproducing purposes. One can also use the output from the distance generator directly. Please see relative section in the walkthrough script for details. 

To reproduce the FPA result, simply run:
```
matlab < writeFluxPotential_dual.m
```
Output (flux distribution and other metrics) will be written in FPA_rxns.mat

### Running FPA on generic <i>C. elegans</i> model with a given expression dataset

We provided a step-by-step [walkthrough script](FPA_walkthrough_generic.m) for running FPA on [iCEL1314](http://wormflux.umassmed.edu/index.html) with any given expression dataset. Users can start with this script to perform FPA analysis on their own expression data. 

This walkthrough script will guide users to generate FPA predictions from a plain expression matrix (<i>i.e</i>, TPM matrix, although other types of datasets, such as FPKM or proteomics, may also be used) to the final predicted FPA values for given target reaction(s). We recommand to go over this script interactively in the MATLAB graphic interface. Please launch a MATLAB instance and set your current directory in this folder (3_FPA). Then, open and go through [walkthrough script](FPA_walkthrough_generic.m) according to the instructions therein.

Users may choose to generate the distance matrix for iCEL1314 via [metabolic distance calculator](./../MetabolicDistance). In this walkthrough script, we will directly use the completed output (see details in the script) in the interest of time, as the calculation of the full distance matrix may take hours unless a computer cluster is being used. For generating the required input from a COBRA formatted model loaded in matlab, please see "2. generate the distance matrix" section in the walkthrough script. This section will guide user to make the required inputs for running the distance calculator.

### Running FPA on another metabolic model with a given expression dataset

We provided a walkthrough guidance of how to run the FPA analysis on human metabolic model [Recon 2.2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27358602/). The expression profile of NCI-60 Cancer Cell lines [Reinhold WC et al, 2019](https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/79/13/3514.long) was used as an example.
