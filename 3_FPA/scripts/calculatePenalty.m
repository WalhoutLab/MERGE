function penalty = calculatePenalty(model,master_expression,manualPenalty)
% calculate the penalty matrix given expression data. It translates the
% expression level of genes to level of reactions by a set of GPR parsing
% rules. In brief, we taking the "sum" of all "OR" gated genes in a single
% GPR and "min" of "AND" ones. Complex GPRs are handled specially by
% converting the GPR annotation to functionally "AND" gated blocks, where
% all "OR" gated genes are added up. In the convertion to blocks, if a
% "AND" gate is nested in an "OR", the minimal value will be taken. For
% detailed explanation, see supplemental information. 
% 
% USAGE:
%
%    penalty = calculatePenalty(model,master_expression,manualPenalty)
%
% NOTE: penalty caluclation uses parfor by default. Please change the parfor loop
 % to for loop if parfor is not supported in your environment
%
% INPUTS:
%    model:             input model (COBRA model structure)
%    master_expression: the expression profiles of queried conditions. The
%                       master expression variable is reqired to be a cell
%                       array of structure variables. Each structure
%                       variable corresponds to the expression profile of a
%                       condition in comparison. The structure variable
%                       should have two fields, "genes" and "value"
%                       respectively. For instructions on forming the
%                       master expression variable from a expression table
%                       (i.e, TPM table in text format), please see
%                       "FPA_walkthrough_generic.m"
% OPTIONAL INPUTS:
%    manualPenalty:     the user defined penalty for specific reactions.
%                       This input will overide all penalty calculation based on expression
%                       data.
%
%
% OUTPUT:
%   penalty:            the full penalty matrix to be directly used in FPA
%                       calculation
