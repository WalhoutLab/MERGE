# Systematic Integration of Gene Expression Data to Understand Tissue-Level Compartmentalization of Metabolic Network Function in C. elegans
# this tag indicates the README file and repo are under development
We developped the package to systematically integrate single cell (also applicable to bulk) RNA-seq data to the metabolic network reconstruction of C. elegans. The package includes three parts: (1) matlab implantation of [iMAT++ algorithm](1_iMAT++), (2) matlab implatation of [original iMAT algorithm](2_iMAT) (for reproducing purpose), and (3) matlab implantation of [Flux Potential Analysis (FPA)](3_FPA). Additionally, we provide a python-based metabolic distance calculator to calculate the metabolic distance in any given metabolic network reconstruction. The [metabolic distance calculator](MetabolicDistance) will generate the required input for applying FPA to any metabolic network. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The programs were developed and tested in MATLAB R2019a/R2017a. [COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (The COBRA Toolbox)](https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/) is required to perform the analysis. Check [here](https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/installation.html) for the installation guidance of COBRA Toolbox. The programs were tested for COBRA Toolbox - 2020 version, but should be compatible with an earlier version. 

The Linear Program (LP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Problem (MILP) solver used in the study is [gurobi]() 8.10. The built-in solver interface of COBRA Toolbox was used, so that we expect our program to also work with other supported solver in COBRA Toolbox. Please [see here](https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/installation.html#solver-installation) for furter information about solver availability. 

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
